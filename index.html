      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Details here...</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born and raised in Washington State.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Video games (PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, etc.)</p>
      <p>Bike riding</p>
      <p>Watching tv/movies</p>
      <p>Watching football (Seahawks, Cougars)</p>
      <p>Traveling</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To enjoy whatever it is that I'm doing. I have long since dreamed of working in the video game industry. I also think it'd be fun to explore space
          but I kind of realized that too late in life.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in <span>Somewhere</span>, WA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've been in the banking industry for the past 16 years and don't like what I'm doing. I have friends who are in web 
          development/programming and what they do sounds like a lot of fun, sounds really cool and they absolutely love their job.
          The litte that I have experienced so far just from doing this pre-work has me really excited for what I can become!
